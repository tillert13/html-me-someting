                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>Like most children across the world; I grew up playing video games. Whenever I had free time I was
                    almost always in my bedroom, surrounded by junk food, with a controller in my hands. One of my
                    earliest childhood memories is when i had a sleepover at a friends house when I was 8, and we stayed
                    up until about 3 in the morning having our first "Ultimate Video Game Tournament". What I would
                    play vaired thoughout the years, but some of my childhood favorites included Jak and Daxter, Super
                    Mario Sunshine, and Tekken.</p>

                <h2>Basketball</h2>
                <p>Even though all i wanted to do was play video games, when i turned 10 my mom thought that it was best
                    for me to be more active and convinced me to tryout for the basketball team. Despite my convincing
                    size, I was never a great athlete and only play for a year, but in just that short year I made many
                    friends, some of which I am still close with today.</p>
