                <h2>Video Games</h2>
                <p>Like most children across the world; I grew up playing video games. Whenever I had free time I was
                    almost always in my bedroom, surrounded by junk food, with a controller in my hands. One of my
                    earliest childhood memories is when i had a sleepover at a friends house when I was 8, and we stayed
                    up until about 3 in the morning having our first "Ultimate Video Game Tournament". What I would
                    play vaired thoughout the years, but some of my childhood favorites included Jak and Daxter, Super
                    Mario Sunshine, and Tekken.</p>

                <h2>Pokemon</h2>
                <p>Out of all of the games that I played throught my youth,the one the is dearest to my heart has to be
                    Pokemon. I started playing when I was 7 and never looked back. I currently play the trading card
                    game competitively, and actually attended the world championships in Washington DC back in August.

                <h2>Basketball</h2>
                <p>Even though all I wanted to do was play video games, when I turned 10 my mom thought that it was best
                    for me to be more active and convinced me to tryout for the basketball team. Despite my convincing
                    size, I was never a great athlete and only play for a year, but in just that short year I made many
                    friends, some of which I am still close with today.</p>

                <h2>Boy Scouts</h2>
                <p>After I decided to quit playnig basketbell, I found out the a few of the guys on the team were
                    actually in Boy Scouts. I had never really known anything about the program and decided to look into
                    it. After a few Google searches and asking around, I signed up. I stuck with the Scouts for about 5
                    years and climbed to the rank of Life Scout.</p>

                <h2>Football</h2>
                <p>Football is actually a sport I joined on a complete whim. I never enjoyed it when I was a kid, but
                    when I was a sophmore in highschool, my friends said that I should try. One quick tryout later and
                    next thing you know I was a juniour varsity running back.</p>

                <h2>Boxing</h2>
                <p>I was always interested in "Combat Sports" growing up. I watched wresting and UFC and enjoyed them,
                    but never thought that that would be something I would ever want to do, but a few years ago my
                    cousin opened his own personal gym and asked me to come check it out. Little did I know that he was
                    going to convince me to try boxing. I was nervous, but gave it a try, and now i love it. I never
                    actually spar, but working with a heavy bag or shadow boxing is a great way to stay in shape while
                    also having fun.</p>
